#Project title
The name of our project is Astrono(ME). We completed this project as part of our Full Stack Flex Coding Program under UNC Chapel Hill.

#Motivation
Our motivation behind the app is to create a fun and informative application that includes an all in one place of information on space exploration.
From images of the day to images of mars from the rover, see asteroids that are coming soon and add them to your calendar along with a bunch of other cool information about space. 

#Build status
This is our first release with hope of future improvements.

#How this app works
In this web application, we have created a fun and educational way for a user to view everything related to space exploration without leaving Earth. From the home page, the user can log in via their Facebook account and search for current stars, asteroids, and astronauts that are currently in space.  On the events page, the user can create a specific upcoming event, or view the list of outstanding asteroids as well as their information. Ultimately, this site will showcase the previously unknown and unseen parts of space, and hopefully pique interest in space exploration and research. Here is the link of our Astrono(ME) app:

#Built with
We used javaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase & Sequelize .

#API Reference
We used the following APIs: Nasa, WikiSKY, Facebook and Wikipedia.

#Contribute
To contribute to this project, please fork this project or clone the repo to your local machine.

#Challenges
Some challenges we encountered were linking Sequelize with our Facebook data - because of this we used Sequalize with our Wikipedia search information.

#Improvements
Future improvements would include linkage to the events page and user wall in Facebook to post asteroid/star events and share them with friends.  We would also like to include the ability to push those events back up into our calendar with draggable capabilities.

#Credits
This was done as part of the school program. Heather Peri, Tiffany Brincefield, Yevheniia Dilekoglu and Chase Vernon are the team members.
